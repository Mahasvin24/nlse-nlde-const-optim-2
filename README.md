# NLSE/NLDE Constant Optimization

This repository is a reimplementation of the findings presented in the ASPLOS 2024 paper **"Energy Efficient Convolutions with Temporal Arithmetic"** ([link](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~sherwood/pubs/ASPLOS-24-temparith.pdf)).

## Overview

The original paper introduces temporal arithmetic techniques to achieve energy-efficient convolutions through optimized constant values. This project extends that work by focusing on improving these constants under noisy conditions, addressing real-world deployment scenarios where noise is inevitable.

## Goals

- Reimplement the temporal arithmetic approach from the ASPLOS 2024 paper
- Optimize temporal constants for robustness under noise
- Develop and evaluate techniques for noisy condition handling
- Benchmark energy efficiency and accuracy trade-offs

## Contributions

This work aims to advance energy-efficient convolution research by studying how constant optimization performs in realistic, noise-affected environments.
